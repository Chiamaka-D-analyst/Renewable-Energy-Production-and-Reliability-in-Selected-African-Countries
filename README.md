Renewable Energy Production and Reliability in Selected African Countries

# Objective:
To analyze renewable energy production and energy reliability in selected African countries and draw policy-relevant insights for sustainable energy planning.

# Key Insights:
The analysis shows that diesel remains the dominant energy source across the three African countries, with Nigeria exhibiting the highest diesel-based energy production. This reflects the continued reliance on fossil fuels, supported by existing infrastructure and fuel availability. Solar energy adoption is increasing, particularly in Kenya, followed by Nigeria and Ghana, highlighting the growing role of decentralized renewable energy systems in improving energy access. Biogas production remains relatively low across the countries, although Nigeria leads among the three. This limited adoption may be attributed to low awareness, cultural acceptance, and insufficient policy support. Integrating biogas more effectively into national energy mixes could enhance energy availability, support waste management, and improve sustainability outcomes. Aligning biogas development with Sustainable Development Goal 7 can support clean cooking, heating, and decentralized electrification across African communities.
